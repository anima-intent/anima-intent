      <t>This document describes the concept and consideration of the
      Autonomic Network Intent, which is used to operate the Autonomic Nodes
      within Autonomic Networks. The background to Autonomic Network (AN) is
      described in <xref target="RFC7575"/> and <xref target="RFC7576"/>. A
      generic autonomic signaling protocol (GRASP) is proposed by <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-anima-grasp"/>, which would be used in the propagation
      of the Autonomic Network Intent.</t>

      <t>The Autonomic Network Intent should be able to be unscrambled by all
      Autonomic Nodes, although certain parts of contents may not be relevant
      to a specific Autonomic Node. The Autonomic Network Intent gives
      operational guidance for every Autonomic Node.</t>

      <t>This document also proposes a generic format for Autonomic Network
      Intent.</t>

      <t>The interface to receive or configure the Autonomic Network Intent is
      out of scope. The distribution mechanism of the Autonomic Network Intent
      is introduced in <xref target="I-D.liu-anima-intent-distribution"/>.</t>

      <t>Note in draft: This version is preliminary. In particular, many
      design details may be subject to change until the anima specifications

             title="Intervention of the Network Running by Autonomic Network Intent">
      <t>The Autonomic Network is supposed to work with minimum intervention
      from human operators. However, it is still needed to receive some form
      of guidance/information/orders in order to meet specific
      requirements.</t>

      <t>Upon receiving the Autonomic Network Intent, the Autonomic Node
      should be able to unscramble the meaning of the intent with no
      ambiguity, and act accordingly.</t>

      <t>Using this intent approach, the operator can manage the network as a
      whole, and does not need to configure specific node(s) in the network
      like what happens in the traditional NMS system. In other words, the
      operator communicates with the Autonomic Network using an abstract or
      high lever intent, and the configurations of the nodes take place
      automatically. By replacing most of the NMS jobs, intent-based
      management makes the network management work much easier than
      before.</t>

      <t>On the other sides, the intent-based and NMS-based management may
      co-exist for a long time, because autonomic behavior will be defined
      function by function. Similarly, at the beginning of defining the
      Autonomic Network Intents, the intent-based method cannot be assumed to
      cover every aspect of network management.</t>

      <t/>

      <section title="Concept of Autonomic Network Intent">
        <t>The definition of Intent can be found in <xref
        target="I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model"/>, which is described as
        an abstract, declarative, high-level policy used to operate an
        autonomic domain, such as an enterprise network. Based on this
        definition, this section further discusses the concept of Autonomic
        Network Intent.</t>

        <t>Autonomic Network Intent consists of different parts, and should
        not be considered as a monolithic block. Different parts of Intent
        will be "interpreted" by different entities in autonomic networks, and
        the "level" of understanding of the intent will impact how the intent
        will be presented to this entity. So there should be "intermediate"
        mechanisms/functions that cater for the intent translation continuum
        across the heterogeneity (in policy capabilities) of the network
        entities. Also, intents will possibly overlap and this overlapping
        should be managed (e.g., avoid conflicts, resolve applicable policies
        in context).</t>

        <t>The description of "abstract" in the definition is relative.
        Different users (e.g., the network administrator, end-users) of the
        network see different levels of network details, so they are in
        different abstraction levels. Meanwhile, different intents or
        different parts of intent may require different levels of abstraction.
        </t>

        <t>The more abstract an intent is, the more intelligent the devices
        are required. In an extreme example, the network operator just needs
        to have only one intent for the network: "the network should work well
        for everything". However, this assumption is not likely to be realized
        in recent years, and this intent requires no or little standardization
        jobs. Besides, if an intent is too abstract, different solutions can
        emerge from different vendors, and it is hard to co-exist for the
        devices from different vendors.</t>

        <t>This document will talk about the intents which need to be
        communicated among devices, and have more detailed requirements. Some
        intents may have a higher abstraction level (e.g. some high-level
        policies), and some may have a lower abstraction level (e.g. some
        network-level parameters). Meanwhile, due to the target of reducing
        human Interventions for the Autonomic Network, detailed configurations
        should be avoided as much as possible.</t>

        <t>{Editor notes: the most important questions here are as follows.
        Are there any configuration parameters of an anima network outside
        intents? Are there different kinds of intents? Need we define a
        "hierarchy" for intents?}</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Administrative Intent and Service Intent">
        <t>The Autonomic Networks are supposed to be self-managed. It includes
        managing the network infrastructure, and also the network services
        that are running over the network infrastructure. However, the network
        services have different features against network administration, as
        listed below. Hence, it may be better to organize them into separated
        Administrative Intent and Service Intent.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A Service Intent may have a smaller scope than the
            Administrative Intent because only the nodes related to the
            service need to know this intent. Although it may only affect a
            few nodes, the Service Intent may also be propagated domain
            wide.</t>

            <t>A Service Intent may have a limited lifetime, while the
            Administrative Intents are normally permanent although the content
            of the Administrative Intent may be updated from time to time.</t>

            <t>There maybe are many Service Intents in the autonomic domain,
            while only one Administrative Intent for a giving Autonomic
            Service Agent.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>{Editor notes: one possibility is to treat the Service Intent as a
        normal Intent for a certain Autonomic Service Agent, such as a
        Autonomic Service Provision Agent.}</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use Cases for Autonomic Network Intent">
        <t>An example of the intent can be found in <xref
        target="I-D.jiang-anima-prefix-management"/>. Other examples include
        what kind of IGP (such as OSPF) or what kind of transport layer
        technology (such as MPLS) should be used for the autonomic domain.</t>

        <t>After these configurations in the network level, detailed
        configurations in every node are not needed; whereas, policy-based
        method will need detailed configurations for every specific node.</t>

        <t>An Intent should contains some common information that are needed
        by every intent and some specific information that influence the
        configuration of the nodes, and the detailed content and format of the
        specific part should be defined under its specific application
        environment by other documents, such as the prefix management intent
        defined in <xref target="I-D.jiang-anima-prefix-management"/>.</t>

        <t>{Editor Notes: as autonomic functions are defined one by one, the
        intent should be developed at a per need basis.}</t>

        <t>{Editor Notes: the intents introduced here look like not that
        abstract, however, it does help to make the network more autonomic,
        and reduce the configuration jobs. Maybe in future, when the autonomic
        node becomes more intelligent, some of the intents defined will
        disappear or be replaced.}</t>

        <section anchor="high-level.policy.usecase"
                 title="High-Level Policy Intent">
          <t>For clarifying the concept of the intent in Autonomic Network,
          this section introduces some autonomic intent examples about the
          high-level polices. Multiple Autonomic Function Agents may be
          involved in the implementation of these intents.</t>

          <t>These abstract policies need to be interpreted by a policy
          continuum to low level commands that the device can understand. The
          detailed realization of the tranlation for these high-level polices
          is out of scope of this document.</t>

          <t>Usecase one:</t>

          <t>Autonomic Network of Operator A is composed of Autonomic Function
          Agents such as load balancing (LB_AFA) and energy saving (ES_AFA).
          Operator A wants to limit the proportion of links loaded over a
          certain threshold and thus defines an Intent to activate load
          balancing if the load is superior to 0.6 on more than 30% of the
          links.</t>

          <t>Meanwhile, operator A wants different load balancing policies per
          (technology, administrative, topology) domain. Let's consider a
          metropolitan network domain and a core network domain, or different
          LB policy for border routers than interior routers. For the
          metropolitan network domain, Operator A defines an Intent to
          minimize the link load variance. For the core network domain,
          Operator A applies the previously defined intent (activate load
          balancing if the load is superior to 0.6 on more than 30% of the
          links). </t>

          <t>The intents will be distributed to the right network domain, and
          take effect after being interpreted and coordinated, and it is easy
          to change them without the need to configure every device
          manually.</t>

          <t>Usecase two:</t>

          <t>This example is about "arranging VM guest distribution". The
          autonomic network is supposed to be able to monitor the CPU/power
          utilization on each host machine, and control the status of each
          host machine (e.g. turn on/off). The operator may have an intent
          "there should be enough hosts to keep CPU utilization less than
          70%", and also another one "there are few enough hosts powered so
          that electricity isn't wasted".</t>

          <t>{Editor Notes: Besides these ones, we are quite open for other
          use cases here.}</t>

          <t/>
        </section>

        <section anchor="network-level.parameter.usecase"
                 title="Network-Level Parameter Intent">
          <t>Due to the system limitations and complexity reasons, some
          intents may just be network-level parameters configured by the
          network operator for a specific autonomic function. These
          configuration parameters can be distributed in the autonomic domain
          to influence the detail configurations on each autonomic node. </t>

          <t>Most of these parameters are for establishing network
          infrastructure. They are likely only needed to be configured once,
          and rarely changed. Meanwhile, these parameters do not need
          coordination with others parameters most of the times. Some examples
          are as follows.</t>

          <t>Usecase three:</t>

          <t>When bootstrapping, the new device needs to know some basic
          parameters about the autonomic domain to complete the process. To
          reduce the complexity of bootstrapping, they are perhaps not need to
          be encrypted. They can be treated as "bootstrapping intent" as a
          special kind of intent.</t>

          <t>Usecase four:</t>

          <t>Assuming we need an autonomic network to run and connect to
          Internet, an IP prefix is needed for the whole autonomic domain in
          the data plane. In this case, we need devices in the autonomic
          domain can configure themselves after the human operator has
          notified the IP prefix for this autonomic network. (Configuring
          every device's IP address manually is not considered a good way in
          autonomic network, and is not recommended here.)</t>

          <t>Usecase five:</t>

          <t>Configuring the routing protocol in the autonomic network
          directly by the operator, assuming it can be ISIS or OSPF.</t>

          <t>Usecase six:</t>

          <t>In the prefix management draft <xref
          target="I-D.jiang-anima-prefix-management"/>, it is suggested that
          the prefix lengths for the CSG, ASG, RSG (different roles in IPRAN)
          should be assigned as an "intent".</t>

          <t/>

          use cases here.}</t>
